                "paragraph 1": "The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one ofthe Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that stillexists. Construction was completed around 2560 BC. For about 3,800 years, the pyramid was the tallestmanmade structure until the Lincoln Cathedral waserected in AD 1311.",
                "paragraph 2": "Archaeologists are uncertain about how the ancient Egyptians built such amassive structure. In particular, the method used to transport the 2.3 million stoneblocks that comprise the pyramid is not known. The smallest of these weighs 1.3tons while the largest is almost 80 tons. One theory is that the blocks were placedon sleds and then dragged to the site of the pyramid. As the pyramid becametaller, ramps were placed around it. (A) This allowed blocks to be added to theupper levels. (B) The labor would have been done entirely by people as the ancient Egyptians did not use oxen or horses as work animals. (C) It is believed that it took30,000 workers 20 years to construct the Great Pyramid. (D) Significant resourceswere also needed to feed and accommodate so many workers.",
                "paragraph 3": "The obvious question is why so much effort was put into building this structure.The Great Pyramid served as a tomb for the Egyptian ruler Khufu. The ancientEgyptians believed that their kings—known as pharaohs—were gods rather thanmortals. Therefore, they had to have impressive tombs. These burial places includednot only the body but also the things needed to enjoy the afterlife. For example,pharaohs were usually buried with beautiful robes, expensive wines, and treasuressuch as rings and necklaces. Also, the interior walls were painted with pictures ofthe dead person’s life. In effect, the pyramids were monuments to the pharaohs"

It is believed to have originated in Asia,but it arrived in Europe in 1347 when trading ships for grains and seeds docked inSicily. Sicilians were horrified to discover that most of the sailors were dead. These“death ships” were immediately sent back out to sea, but, unfortunately, it was toolate.",

People whocaught the plague would develop a fever and become weak. They experiencedsevere swelling in the groin and armpits that would grow to the size of an apple. Furthermore, the body became covered in black sores, from which the Black Deathgets its name. Left untreated, people would usually die within 72 hours.",
                "paragraph 3": "While we now have medicine to treat the plague, the doctors back then did notknow what to do. A common practice involved withdrawing “bad blood” from the body. (A) Many tried drinking vinegar or eating crushed minerals, like emeralds. (B) Interestingly, the best chance for survival was a strategy still used today: socialdistancing. (C) This means that potential victims maintained a safe distance fromother people. (D) However, only the wealthy were able to flee crowded cities and goto remote estates where they stayed away from everyone else.",
                "paragraph 4": "In the end, most caught the feared illness and many died. The combination ofa high fatality rate, easy transmission, and no treatment killed roughly 25 millionpeople—almost half of Europe. It would take 200 years for population levels torecover to previous levels"

Known as green icebergs, theseoddities are only found in certain parts of Antarctica. There had been reports of green icebergs for morethan a century, but no one could explain the reasonfor their color until recently.",
                "paragraph 2": "Regular icebergs are made of compressed snow that turns to ice. (A) The bluecolor of the ice is what we typically see. (B) However, green icebergs are made ofmarine ice—ocean water frozen to the underside of the ice shelf—and not snow. (C) The marine ice that makes green icebergs is much darker and has a distinct greenhue. (D)",
                "paragraph 3": "At first, scientists thought that dissolved organic matter in the ice was thereason for the coloring. It is yellowish in color, so mixing it with pure blue icewould create a green hue. However, when they sampled icebergs, they found thegreen and blue marine ice had the same amount of organic material. In addition,researchers determined that the quantity was too small to make a difference in thecoloring, which suggested that something else had to be responsible.",
                "paragraph 4": "They came across a clue while measuring iron levels in the icebergs. Totheir surprise, green icebergs had 500 times more iron than regular ones. As ironoxides in rocks are mostly yellow, scientists began to form a new theory basedon the presence of the iron oxides in icebergs. As glaciers in Antarctica traveledover bedrock, they would grind the rocks into a powder called “rock flour.” Therock flour would flow into the ocean and become frozen into part of the marine ice. The combination of blue ice and yellow iron oxides created green hues around theedges of glaciers. When pieces of these broke off, they became the rare greenicebergs"

This may take the form of a barrier, such as the numerous layers of bark on a treethat keep out all but the most determined insects. Many other plants have thorns,like roses, or prickly spines, such as those of cacti. These give the flora a fitnessadvantage by deterring herbivores. Some physical defenses are much more subtle. For instance, one species of tropical vine has yellow markings on its leaves thatresemble the eggs of Heliconius butterflies. This discourages the butterflies fromlaying their eggs, which is an advantage because the larvae of this insect feed onthe vine.",

For example,ant plants form a symbiotic relationship with ants. They produce nectar for antsto eat and have hollow internal structures that are suitable for them to build theirnests in. In return, the ants will attack any herbivore that attempts to damage theplant. This shows just how ingenious plants can be when it comes to protectingthemselves"

                "paragraph 2": "Few actions are as universal as yawning. People ofevery description yawn. Even animals such as dogs,snakes, and fish yawn. We know when yawning ismost likely to happen. When we are tired or fatigued,yawns are sure to follow. It is often the very first thing a person does upon wakingup. Sometimes yawns are a sign of boredom. Even so, we do not yet know what biological purpose yawning serves. One common belief is that people yawn to get more oxygen into their bodies. It’s true that we inhale more oxygen and exhale more carbon dioxide duringa yawn than a regular breath. (A) However, studies have shown that theamount of oxygen available does not bear any relationship to our likelihoodto yawn. (B) A more likely explanation is that we yawn to wake ourselves up. (C) Yawning also stimulates muscles in the ear that increase alertness and help usmonitor our surroundings. (D) Surprisingly, it’s also possible that we yawn in order tocool the brain. The air we breathe in when we yawn lowers the temperature of theblood flowing to the brain.",
                "paragraph 3": "Yawning also serves a social purpose, creating a bond between individuals.There is a connection between yawning and empathy: the closer you are tosomeone emotionally, the more likely you are to yawn contagiously. People withhigher levels of empathy are more likely to yawn when they notice someone elseyawn. Scientists are still studying this phenomenon. It is difficult to think of anotherbehavior that is so common and yet so little understood"

Instead, it is a chain of islands in the Pacific Ocean: The BigIsland, Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai, among others. Geologists have longbeen fascinated by the volcanic activity that formed the Hawaiian Islands.",
                "paragraph 2": "To understand the special way that Hawaii was formed, it helps to understandhow volcanoes usually occur. The earth’s crust is made up of several tectonicplates that slowly move over the surface of the planet. Traditional volcanoes, likeMount St. Helens in Washington State, arise at the boundaries of tectonic plates. Inthis model, two neighboring plates collide, with one being forced under the other. Asthe plate moves down into the earth, it melts. This causes hot magma to erupt tothe surface, forming volcanoes.",
                "paragraph 3": "However, Hawaii’s volcanoes formed about 2,000 miles from the boundaries ofthe Pacific Plate. Between the earth’s crust and the core is the mantle, a particularlyhot layer at one point in the middle of the plate. (A) Starting about 30 million yearsago, the Pacific Plate slid over this hot spot at a pace of three to four inches peryear. (B) Molten rock (magma) ascended through the mantle until it erupted on theseafloor forming a volcano. (C) One after another, the Hawaiian Islands formed asthe sliding conveyor belt of the Pacific Plate moved over the hot spot. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "Hawaii’s volcanoes are gradually moving away from the hot spot. As they getfurther away from the source of their creation, volcanic eruptions of hot magmabecome less and less common on the islands. Eventually, the volcanoes thatformed the islands will die. As a result, the islands will erode and begin to sink intothe sea. In millions of years, the part of the Pacific Plate that carries the islandswill move under the North American plate. It will cause the Hawaiian Islands todisappear forever"

(A) The ancient Greeks stagedtheir plays in outdoor theaters with only the sun toprovide light. (B) The sun would illuminate the stagefrom behind the audience. (C) Additionally, the Greekswould pause the performance to take advantage ofthe changing position of the sun. (D) They also directed the sunlight to where theywanted it using large mirrors.",
                "paragraph 2": "The next major stage lighting innovation happened during the ItalianRenaissance. In the late 1500s, candles would be hung from the ceiling inchandeliers or placed at the edge of the stage as footlights. Thousands of candleswere required to provide adequate lighting. Of course, this made it more costly toput on a play, as candles were quite expensive at this time. Another problem wasthat there was a significant danger that the theater would catch on fire. Also, thecandles would consume so much oxygen that the cast and audience could be leftgasping for air. Sometimes people would faint.",
                "paragraph 3": "In 1783, France introduced the kerosene oil lamp, which was superior tothe candle because it could be adjusted to provide a higher or lower flame. For100 years, oil was the preferred way to light the stage. However, oil lamps wereexpensive. Gaslight, introduced in the early 1800s, was cheaper. It also providedcontrol. Using valves to release gas into a system of pipes, light could be directedonto the stage at different angles and levels of brightness.",
                "paragraph 4": "Electric lamps were introduced in 1873. A year after they were invented, the ParisOpera began using them. In the early twentieth century, electric lighting began tobe colored by placing a gel in front of a lamp. This was made of plastic and gavedesigners the ability to build complex lighting plots that set the mood of a scene. Different colors could be blended for effect. Lighting became as important to theemotional impact of a play as the actors’ performances"

They had short armsand legs, leaving them with minimally exposed skin. They also had extremely widenoses. This feature enabled them to warm and humidify the cold, dry air in theirexpansive nasal cavities.",

Some 44,000 years ago, average temperaturesin Europe dropped below zero degrees Celsius, and the Neanderthals began todisappear. Some scientists think that large mammals were dying off at the time,leaving the Neanderthals with little food. Other scientists disagree, believing that theNeanderthals were simply unable to compete with our own species. Regardless, theNeanderthals’ remarkable survival story ended, and the territories where they oncedwelled were soon the home of Homo sapiens"

Some are emitted in solar flares from the Sun, and someoriginate from deeper in the galaxy or even outside the Milky Way. Every second,Earth is bombarded by roughly 10,000 cosmic rays per square meter. Much of thiscosmic radiation is deflected by the planet’s magnetic shield, but some makes itinto the upper atmosphere and to the surface.",
                "paragraph 2": "Studying cosmic rays is not always easy. Because they can be deflected bymagnetic shields in space, cosmic rays cannot be traced directly back to theirsource. Instead, scientists deduce the origins of cosmic rays by examining theirabundance and composition. Austrian physicist Victor Hess first discovered cosmicrays in 1912 by measuring radiation as he ascended into the upper atmosphere ina hot air balloon. He was testing the hypothesis that radiation came from Earth’score, but it turned out that the amount of radiation increased as he got higher dueto the presence of cosmic rays. Since then, scientists have learned that about 89percent of cosmic rays are lightweight hydrogen protons, 10 percent are helium,and 1 percent are heavier nuclei like uranium.",
                "paragraph 3": "(A) Scientists make the effort to study the cosmic rays that reach Earth in thehope that these tiny particles will reveal the secrets of massive stellar events deepin space, like the birth or death of a star. (B) They have long suspected that higherenergy cosmic rays are produced when supernova remnants explode in space. (C) In 2017, researchers confirmed this when they detected waves from the merger of twoneutron stars. (D) This has made scientists believe that they will be able to researchsimilar phenomena in the future by identifying the cosmic rays they produce"

                "paragraph 1": "Every spring, millions of birds migrate northto territories that are not oppressively hot. Thesetemperate regions provide more opportunities forfood. Then, in autumn, the birds return to warmerregions in the south to avoid harsh winters. Thesemiraculous journeys can be as long as 16,000 miles. Scientists are still experimenting in an effort to learnhow they do it, and the answer lies in the birds’ ability to both orient and navigate.",
                "paragraph 2": "To orient is to determine one’s magnetic compass direction. Scientists haveidentified a region in the front of some birds’ brains that they call “Cluster N.”This part of the brain seems to interact with the birds’ eyes when flying at night,pointing them toward north. But even when Cluster N is not active, birds canstill use the setting sun or the position of the stars to find north, just as humansdo. Researchers have confirmed this by conducting experiments in planetariums,which are large, dome-like theaters that present visual representations of the nightsky. The birds normally use Polaris, the North Star, to head in the right direction. However, when the planetarium stars revolved around the star Betelgeuse insteadof Polaris, the birds used Betelgeuse to orient.",
                "paragraph 3": "The second ability a bird must have is to navigate, which means to assessits position mid-flight. (A) One of the ways birds achieve this feat is to rely on theirsense of smell. (B) Their beaks develop an olfactory map of the odors along theirpath. (C) Another avian trick may be to use the trigeminal nerve in their beaks todetermine how strong the earth’s magnetic fields are at a given location. (D) Inthis way, they can tell how close they are to the earth’s poles or to the equator. Itseems that birds have multiple methods for orienting and navigating so that theycan find their way under any circumstances"

                "paragraph 1": "Whether they are sprinkling salt on their food, wearing diamond rings, or brushingtheir teeth with fluoride, most people interact with minerals every day of their liveswithout understanding what they are. There are four essential characteristics that allminerals share.",
                "paragraph 2": "To begin with, minerals are naturally formed. There are many materials madein laboratories that mimic mineral properties, but these are not technically minerals. For example, a synthetic emerald may have a green sparkle similar to the realthing and may even be made from the same chemicals. But if an emerald was notnaturally formed from beryllium that has escaped from magma deep in the earth’scrust, it is not truly a mineral and, consequently, does not have the same value. Many minerals are formed from cooled magma; others crystallize in water.",
                "paragraph 3": "While some minerals form in water, a substance must be solid in order to beclassified as a mineral. In fact, minerals can be among the hardest solids on theplanet. (A) Geologists measure the hardness of minerals using the Mohs scale, which determines how easy it is to scratch a mineral. (B) Diamond rates a score of 10 out of 10 on the Mohs scale because it is virtually impossible to scratch. (C) Onthe other hand, the mineral talc can be easily crushed into talcum powder (which isfound in makeup or baby powder), so it rates a 1 on the Mohs scale. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "The third characteristic of minerals is that they have a consistent chemicalcomposition, right down to the atomic level. In other words, the atoms thatconstitute the mineral must be in a specific chemical ratio. For instance, the earth’smost common mineral, quartz, is one part silicon and two parts oxygen. Someminerals, like gold, consist of a single element.",
                "paragraph 5": "Finally, every mineral has a crystalline structure, which means that the atomsare organized in a geometric pattern. For that reason, minerals are among the mostbeautiful substances on the earth. The Romans thought opal had mystical powersbecause its crystals can flash every color in the spectrum"

The structures are exceptional insize, design, and durability . They are made of stoneand were built on the cliffs of Mesa Verde, Colorado. At first glance, the dwellings appear to be very largemulti-storied apartment complexes with square windows but no doors. The Anasazientered the buildings by climbing a ladder and going through a hole in the roof. Historians speculate that it may have taken the Anasazi eighty years to constructthe dwellings and that only a century after they were completed, the Anasaziabandoned these beautiful, sturdy homes.",
                "paragraph 2": "These cliff dwellings are an archaeological goldmine that reveals much aboutthe people who lived there. Climatic conditions could be brutal in the ancientColorado Desert, including extended periods of drought. But the dwellings wereconstructed at a point in history (around AD 1190) when they were fairly stable. The Anasazi population was at a high point. This prompted their move from simplepit houses, partially underground, to the elaborate homes in the cliffs. They hunteddeer and bighorn sheep and feasted on domesticated turkeys. They could easilyslip up and down the narrow ladders because they were a small people, rangingfrom 5’1’’ to 5’5’’ in height.",
                "paragraph 3": "Why did the Anasazi leave these architectural wonders so abruptly? Thereappear to be several reasons. (A) The more they hunted big game for food, the lessabundant those animals became. (B) Deforestation also contributed to the lack ofavailable resources. (C) In 1276, a drought struck that lasted for 23 long years. (D) In addition to these unfavorable environmental conditions, the Anasazi may have beenattacked in their homes. Archaeologists uncovered the remains of some 34 peoplethat were never formally buried. At least eight of those skeletons bore evidence ofviolent causes of death. Whatever the reasons, the surviving Anasazi made theirway south toward sites in Arizona and New Mexico. The ruins of the cliff dwellingsremained empty for centuries until they were discovered by cowboys in the 1880s. Today, they are preserved in a national park"

            {
                "paragraph 1": "The history of recorded sound began when Thomas Edison invented thephonograph. Edison envisioned that his “talking machine” would ultimately be inevery American home. In his era, in-home music was a luxury that was mainlyenjoyed by the rich. With the mass production of the phonograph, he hoped to makeit affordable for everyone to listen to music in their homes. However, his primarymotivation was to create a system to record telephone messages. He believed thatbusinesspeople would be the first to buy the device, thinking that sound recordingscould offer an alternative to written messages in business communication. In thissense, Edison’s phonograph was a precursor of contemporary voicemail.",
                "paragraph 2": "One night in July of 1877, Edison and his staff worked out a sound-recordingtechnique in his laboratory. He knew that sound waves could generate vibrationson a thin membrane, called a diaphragm. He wondered if the vibrations could beused to create marks by attaching something like a needle with a hard point tothe diaphragm. So he asked an employee to connect one to a diaphragm, whichitself was attached to a telephone speaker. As Edison shouted into the speaker,the diaphragm vibrated, causing the needle to move and etch the sound marksinto a piece of wax-covered paper below. When the pattern on the piece of paperwas guided back under the needle, to everyone’s amazement, Edison’s voice wasplayed back.",
                "paragraph 3": "Edison soon made a technical drawing of his phonograph design, and, byDecember of 1877, his engineering team had created the first working model. (A) It was publicly demonstrated at the publishing office of the magazine ScientificAmerican. (B) Huge crowds of people assembled to listen to the talking machine. (C) Yet the original design was mainly just a curiosity as it had limited commercialvalue and was only suitable for exhibits. (D) Because it could only record one or twominutes of sound, it was not practical for extensive use. Moreover, the sound qualitywas poor, so some listeners could not understand the words coming from the speaker. Therefore, Edison had to make modifications. In 1887 and 1888, he manufacturedan improved phonograph and a perfected phonograph, which he marketed under theEdison Phonograph Company. Although Edison’s phonographs were commerciallysuccessful, their cost never actually became affordable for everyone"

            {
                "paragraph 1": "The changing colors of tree leaves are partly due to the changing of theseasons. As the seasons change, plants produce different pigments. There are threemain pigment classes that are produced in a leaf: chlorophyll, carotenoids, andflavonoids. During the spring and summer, leaves serve as factories where muchof the food a tree needs is manufactured. This process requires chlorophyll, whichgives a leaf its green color. However, as the seasons become colder, the chemicalprocesses that take place in a tree result in leaves that are a mixture of red, purple,orange, and yellow. Changes in temperature and the length of daylight cause theleaves to stop their food-making process. With this stoppage, the chlorophyll breaksdown, and the green color disappears, to be replaced with the colors of autumn.",
                "paragraph 2": "The amount and type of pigment present as well as chemical interactionswithin the plant can also determine the color of a leaf. Because chlorophyll isabundant during the spring and summer seasons, the other pigments in a leaf aremasked. During the fall, the decomposition rate of chlorophyll remains constant evenduring the time that its production slows down. Therefore, the green color of a leaffades gradually rather than abruptly . A greater amount of the carotenoid pigmentin a leaf will produce yellow, while a larger proportion of flavonoids will producered, blue, purple, and magenta. If a leaf has equal proportions of carotenoids andflavonoids, the color orange often results. In the absence of pigments, other plantchemicals can affect leaf color. For example, tannin often produces the brownishcolor of oak leaves.",
                "paragraph 3": "As temperatures decrease, the process of abscission (detachment) begins. (A) At the beginning of autumn, a special layer called the abscission zone developsat the point where the leaf is attached to the stem. (B) Eventually, the stem can nolonger support the leaf, and it falls in the breeze. (C) The tree then seals the cut,and a scar develops where the leaf was once attached. (D) The tree is ready for along winter’s nap"

                "paragraph 1": "Many meteorites are found in the polar regions, buried deep under the ice. Thisis not because there is a higher incidence of their falling at Earth’s poles. Rather,the cold and dry conditions preserve the meteorites for many years, and they areeasier to distinguish against the icy, white environment. On December 27, 1984,Roberta Stone discovered a Martian meteorite called ALH84001 on the Allan Hills inAntarctica.",
                "paragraph 2": "At first, the meteorite was classified as a diogenite, believed to have comefrom the asteroid belt. It was put away for ten years until an American scientiststudying diogenites requested a sample for study. He noticed it was unlike otherdiogenites he had studied and requested an isotope analysis. Oxygen isotopiccomposition refers to the relative amounts of the three stable isotopes of oxygen16O, 17O, and 18O present in a rock. Samples with similar isotopic compositionsbelong to the same family and presumably come from the same parent. (A) Since the oxygen isotopic composition of the meteorite was different from that of Earth’s rocks, it could not have come from our home planet. (B) Another meteorite foundin India is believed to have come from Mars because it, too, contained ratios of oxygen and nitrogen isotopes not found on Earth. (C) Analysis of carbonates inthese two meteorites indicated that they were formed from fluids in contact with the atmosphere of Mars. (D)",
                "paragraph 3": "ALH84001 sparked worldwide headlines when further analysis suggested thatlife might have existed on Mars. Many theories have been put forward regardingthe meteorite. Although scientists agree on the data, they disagree on theinterpretations of these experimental results. Some believe that the 4.5-billion-yearoldmeteorite was formed under wet conditions, suggesting water and life existed onMars before they did on Earth. Others suggest that the meteorite may even havetransported Martian life here. They further propose that we may all be descendantsof Martian life forms. Later experiments revealed that the salty ice of Antarctica might have contaminated the meteorites. Scientists now agree that the evidenceof life on Mars from ALH84001, although compelling, is inconclusive. Nevertheless,ALH84001 is one of the oldest meteorites discovered to date and continues to yieldnew information about meteorites and Mars"

                "paragraph 1": "The modern printing press emerged in the fifteenth century in Germany. Incontrast to previous printing technologies in the West, this press contained movabletype, so it could easily produce many different letter and word combinations. Although many people worked on developing the modern printing press, JohannesGutenberg is usually acknowledged as its creator.",
                "paragraph 2": "At first, Gutenberg worked on a way to reproduce printed materials moreefficiently. He experienced many failures, particularly because the materials herequired were expensive and he was always in need of investors. Some investorsknew the economic value of his printing technology and tried to take it forthemselves through legal action. Thus, Gutenberg spent much time and money onlawyers and court fees, and his project’s advancement was slow.",
                "paragraph 3": "However, he succeeded in making efficient printing presses in the 1450s. These presses had frames that were designed to produce forty-two lines of typein two columns, for a total of eighty-four lines. (A) Each frame could be fitted with a tray that holds the metal type. (B) Within each tray, the metal type—whichrepresented letters of the alphabet—was assembled into words and lines. (C) Once the entire frame was filled, a piece of paper was firmly pressed against the rowsof type, which were covered in ink. (D) Because the metal type could be altered torepresent any text, workers could conveniently reposition it for printing each page ina book or manuscript without much wasted time or effort.",
                "paragraph 4": "Gutenberg’s method of publication led to dramatic and far-reaching effects onsociety and knowledge. Initially, it was used to print the Gutenberg Bible. This Biblewas more than 1,200 pages long, and Gutenberg’s press could produce thousandsof copies in the same amount of time it would have taken scribes to make justone copy in the conventional way. Later, the press was used by Martin Luther toprint 300,000 copies of his Ninety-Five Theses, which divided the Catholic Churchand started the Protestant Reformation. In addition, the press allowed for widerdistribution of the classical Roman, Greek, and Arabic literature that inspired theRenaissance. It also helped natural philosophers to more freely share their scientificand mathematical ideas. Indeed, without the printing press, the Scientific Revolutionof the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries would not have been possible"

            {
                "paragraph 1": "The rock pocket mouse is one of nineteen species of pocket mice. They are solitary, nocturnal animals that live all around the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States. A typical specimen is about 170 millimeters and roughly 15 grams in weight, meaning this tiny mouse weighs about as much as a handful of paper clips.",
                "paragraph 2": "While there appears to be nothing special in particular about these rodents, evolutionary biologists have been quite **intrigued** by the species and have conducted numerous studies on their fur color since the early 1930s. The most common variety of this species has a sandy, light-colored coat. This color pattern helps them blend in with the desert rocks and sand where they live.",
                "paragraph 3": "However, populations of rock pocket mice that have a darker coloring have also been found in nearby areas. Scientists discovered that these groups lived on strips of the desert where the ground was covered in dark patches of volcanic rock called basalt which was formed by **lava flows** from volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago. Seeing this, scientists **combed through** the data compiled from both light and dark-colored populations to search for any specific gene that may have caused the difference. After thorough analysis, a mutation in a certain gene turned out to be the determiner of coat color.",
                "paragraph 4": "A gene mutation is any change in the DNA sequence of a gene. Gene mutations can alter the structure of the resulting protein, which can change the way it functions. In the case of the rock pocket mice, a direct association was discovered between the mutated gene and coat color. Mice that possessed **it** had more **melanin** while the mice with no gene mutation remained lighter. The primary cause of the mutation was found to be what biologists call **selective pressure**, which affects an organism's ability to survive in a given environment. For rock pocket mice, the color of the environment pressured the gene to mutate in the mice living on the basalt to help them camouflage better, ensuring higher survival rates and better protection from predators. It is a prime example of adaptation through natural selection."

                "paragraph 1": "When we hear something, it happens in a split second, and we recognize it instantly. Yet despite this speedy reaction, the process of hearing is quite **complicated**. Sound waves first enter the ear canal and strike the **eardrum**, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations then move along to the bones in the middle ear. As the eardrum vibrates, so do these bones, and this sets the fluid of the cochlea, a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear, in motion. As the fluid moves in the cochlea in a wave-like manner, the alternating changes in pressure stimulate the hair cells. As these cells move up and down, they transform the vibration into an electrical signal that is carried to the brain and turned into sounds that we understand.",
                "paragraph 2": "Hearing well depends on the entire **system** working together so that sound can reach the brain and be processed without **disruption**. Thus, if a person has a hearing problem, the specific type depends on which part of the auditory system is not responding well. For example, if you have a problem in the outer or middle ear, it usually means there is an inefficient transfer of vibrations from the eardrum to the cochlea. Generally, this affects the volume of what you hear, so sound can seem muted and low. This is called conductive hearing loss because sound vibrations are not being conducted efficiently. With this kind of hearing issue, a bone conduction hearing device is used in place of traditional hearing aids. The device transfers sound by bone vibration directly to the cochlea. This is necessary because the cochlea is still working normally but simply not receiving enough information via its connection with the middle ear.",
                "paragraph 3": "On the other hand, if a problem occurs in a part of the system between the cochlea and the brain, it is called sensorineural hearing loss. In this case, sound is not processed after reaching the cochlea either because of damaged hair cells or because of defects in the auditory pathway leading to the brain. This type of hearing loss is due to constant exposure to loud noises or simply because of aging. Sometimes, surgery can help remedy the situation, but in most cases, a conventional hearing aid is used to fix it."

It was founded by the Mexica people around AD 1325 after they left their homeland of Aztlan in response to what they believed was a command from their god, Huitzilopochtli. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli directed them to build the city in the place where they saw an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a snake. They saw this vision on an island in Lake Texcoco, where they eventually settled.",
                "paragraph 2": "The early years for the Mexica were difficult as they tried to build up their new home. The people lived in small huts, the sacred temple for Huitzilopochtli was made of perishable material. The city even had to pay regular tribute to the neighboring city of Azcapotzalco, which ruled over them. Their challenging life began to change when the Tenochtitlan ruler, Itzcoatl, detected infighting and political instability at Azcapotzalco. He took the opportunity to form **alliances** with other smaller cities and eventually gained Tenochtitlan its independence.",
                "paragraph 3": "From those humble beginnings, Tenochtitlan became the center of the empire over the next 80 years. Now, the Mexica people were receiving tribute and conquering nearby regions. The city grew in wealth and power as well as in infrastructure. The residents had enough material to build an aqueduct that brought in potable water from the lake and a proper temple dedicated to both Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, the god of rain and fertility. The city’s wealth, **ample** natural resources, and strategic position on the lake boosted its trade market, making it an economic and political powerhouse.",
                "paragraph 4": "Unfortunately, the golden age of Tenochtitlan would come to an end when the Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés landed in Mexico in 1519. The arrival of the Spanish signaled the downfall of the Aztec Empire. Cortés was initially greeted warmly by the Mexica and given gifts of gold. They hoped that the signs of respect would please him and he would leave them in peace. Of course, knowing so much gold was available in the city only increased Cortés’ desire to conquer it. He returned several months later with an army of 700 soldiers and 70,000 native troops who had allied themselves with the Spanish. They laid siege to Tenochtitlan for 93 days—burning, looting, and destroying everything they could—until the Mexica finally surrendered on August 13, 1521."

                "paragraph 1": "The Nickelodeon was the first commercial movie theater to open in the United States. During the early 1900s, this type of storefront theater became a popular entertainment facility due to the public's growing interest in film. Soon, more than 8,000 theaters were popping up across the country.",
                "paragraph 2": "Before then, movies themselves were minor distractions at **vaudeville** shows, which featured a variety of different types of entertainment, and were not considered **substantial** enough to warrant their own facilities. This is because a film, at the time, was merely a collection of “shadow” images—such as a couple dancing or a man sneezing—that were shown between vaudeville acts. As a result, it was almost like a commercial, if commercials only consisted of moving images with no plot or narrative. However, it was not long before it occurred to some clever innovators to tell a story with **them**. As film and projection techniques advanced, so did the excitement for this new form of entertainment.",
                "paragraph 3": "It was Harry Davis, a vaudeville organizer, who saw an opportunity and decided to devote an entire theater **exclusively** for showing films. He bought a machine called a cinematograph and set up chairs and a screen in a storefront on Smithfield Street in downtown Pittsburgh. He decided his first showing would be a film that already had some popularity: *The Great Train Robbery*, a ten-minute film about outlaws robbing a train. He and his brother-in-law opened the Nickelodeon, as he dubbed it, on June 19, 1905, to a delighted public.",
                "paragraph 4": "They took in over 400 customers on the first day and more than 1,000 on the next. Everyone was eager to get in on the experience, and the Nickelodeon was the ideal venue. First of all, since the movie did not require live performers, no breaks were needed. This allowed Davis to keep the theater open from eight in the morning until midnight, with multiple shows every hour. It also meant he could keep admission fees low. Whereas it cost a pricey twenty-five cents to go to a vaudeville show, the theater on Smithfield Street only charged five cents so that anyone could attend. In fact, that’s where Davis got the name for his theater; he combined the price of admission, a nickel, with the Greek word for theater, odeon."

                "paragraph 1": "The Stanford Prison Experiment was a 1971 psychological study in which subjects were randomly divided into guards and prisoners in a simulated prison environment at Stanford University. The participants, undergraduate students, were paid $15 per day to be confined to or to guard three cells, each housing three prisoners. Within a few days, the guards were engaging in aggressive and abusive behavior while the prisoners exhibited symptoms of severe anxiety and emotional distress. The guards abused their powers to the point that the experiment had to be eventually stopped, days before it was scheduled to end.",
                "paragraph 2": "The experiment revealed how people willingly **conform to** the social roles they are expected to play even if doing so means harming other people. In other words, if people are given power over others, they will abuse that power. And people who are put into situations where they are powerless will be driven to obedience. The findings of the experiment were widely reported in the media and became a fixture of psychology textbooks. **They** have also been the subject of numerous books, movies, television programs, and documentaries.",
                "paragraph 3": "Despite the experiment’s established position among the most important studies in social science history, there have been repeated complaints about flaws in its design and implementation. For one thing, the participants were all white middle-class males. The lack of demographic diversity among the participants calls into question **its** validity with regard to humanity as a whole. The experiment also failed to realistically simulate a prison environment, leading many to question the study’s value as a representation of behavior in a typical penal **institution**.",
                "paragraph 4": "The most significant criticisms of the experiment concern violations of scientific ethics. A 2015 study published in the journal *American Psychologist* revealed recordings of the researchers instructing the guards to behave aggressively toward the prisoners. The researchers even admitted that they were motivated by the desire to receive press attention. Instead of slipping automatically into an oppressive social role, many of the guards resisted the researchers’ directions. Moreover, one of the prisoners confessed to faking emotional distress in order to get out of the experiment."

                "paragraph 1": "Many animals avoid predators by hiding, while others ward off would-be threats by making themselves as **conspicuous** as possible. Animals in the former group use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Animals in the latter group use a tactic called warning coloration, whereby brightly colored skin or distinctive fur markings signal to predators that an animal is harmful or has a disgusting taste. Predators that eat one of these animals remember the experience and learn to avoid repeating it.",
                "paragraph 2": "The defensive mechanisms used by animals with warning coloration vary widely. The striking white and black stripes of the skunk are easily recognizable by other animals, allowing them to avoid this creature’s foul-smelling emissions. The brilliant blue, red, yellow, and green colors of the poison dart frog alert other animals to its deadly toxic secretions. The blue-ringed octopus is a sea creature with a similar strategy: its blue rings light up and glow to warn others of its powerful venom. In the insect kingdom, butterflies and ladybugs utilize colorful exteriors to communicate the fact that they make a distinctly unappetizing meal.",
                "paragraph 3": "Warning coloration is such an effective evolutionary strategy that other animals with no defensive mechanism sometimes mimic the distinctive coloration of other creatures. British naturalist Henry Walter Bates discovered in the mid-nineteenth century that some insects exhibit startling colors even though they do not have harmful effects to back **them** up. For instance, the yellowjacket fly has the striking yellow coloring of a wasp but has no sting. This is called Batesian **mimicry**, and it works best when the animals with defensive mechanisms outnumber those without.",
                "paragraph 4": "The other type of warning coloration imitation is Müllerian mimicry, named for German zoologist Fritz Müller. Müllerian mimicry differs from Batesian mimicry because all species involved are unpleasant to predators. In Müllerian mimicry, one or more animal species develop similar colorations in order to increase the chances that predators will recognize **their** dangerous properties. Each of these species is either toxic or inedible by predators. Predators may only encounter one species, while others are protected because they look similar."

                "paragraph 1": "Dime novels were short books printed on cheap paper and sold for five to ten cents. Dominated by adventure stories, they were immensely popular in the United States in the late 1800s. The format owed its existence to the emergence of cheap paper and advances in printing technology, which made it profitable to produce 100-page serial tales and sell them at prices nearly everyone could afford.",
                "paragraph 2": "The content of dime novels was commercially driven. In the beginning, they focused on the exotic lives of Native Americans, a topic of great fascination to the American public. As the Native Americans moved to **reservations** and out of the public view, dime novels changed their focus to the equally lucrative subjects of cowboys and crime. Eventually, the books covered other genres like romance. Writers hired to pen dime novels understood that **they** were expected to focus on exciting storylines, not character development or narrative experimentation. Dime novel publishers paid well, so they attracted top-notch writers such as Upton Sinclair, Jack London, and Louisa May Alcott.",
                "paragraph 3": "While dime novels were not innovative, they did help to foster a more literate populace. When the format emerged, literacy rates were already rising as a result of educational reforms and enforcement of **mandatory** school attendance for people of all social classes. There were other factors at play as well. Oil lamps were making it easier to read at night. More people were starting to commute by train and streetcar, giving them time to read. Civil War soldiers on both sides had to be entertained during boring days of inaction. All lower-class readers needed was affordable reading material with stories that were accessible to the masses. Dime novels filled that void.",
                "paragraph 4": "If the lower class devoured dime novels with delight, moralists in the middle class worried about **their** corrupting influence. Many considered the books a guilty pleasure. Some went so far as to describe them as “literary poison” and “evil reading,” objecting especially to their depictions of criminals and assertive women. Yet far from teaching immorality, dime novels always featured protagonists who did the right thing when faced with moral dilemmas. The same companies that published dime novels eventually also printed moralizing tracts, religious books, and other works intended to uplift and instruct the masses."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "The American Civil War was a challenging time for the country. The total American deaths from the war exceeded those of World War I and World War II combined. Political divisions tore entire communities apart, sometimes making brothers enemies of one another, and **these** were so deep that the two sides could not avoid military conflict. Slavery is often given as the primary reason for the war. Yet disputes over the type of governance were equally important. Generally, the **Union** supported a **robust** centralized government, while the **Confederacy** favored a more democratic system based on states’ rights. Ultimately, the former won the war, and the reasons for the Confederacy’s loss can be viewed through internal and external factors.",
                "paragraph 2": "There are some plausible explanations for the internal-cause argument. First, because the war was waged primarily in the South, Southerners grew very weary of war. They witnessed the burning of their towns and the destruction of their homes and farms by Union troops. Seeing these events firsthand led to feelings of low morale, and by 1865, **many** began to vehemently oppose the war. Some Confederate soldiers even began to desert the army. Also, the institution of slavery itself hurt the Confederate cause. Thousands of slaves fled to the North, and some of them joined the war effort. The slave migration directly strengthened the Union army by more than 100,000 men. Finally, the economy of the Confederate states was based on labor-intensive agriculture. As a result, its industrial and technological capabilities were not very advanced.",
                "paragraph 3": "Still, experts generally agree that the main reasons for the defeat of the Confederate states by the Union states were external. The Union was simply superior in military, economic, and industrial resources. It had a population of 18.5 million, approximately three times the number of soldiers, and considerably more money in the bank. Also, prior to the start of the war, it manufactured 97 percent of the country’s firearms and had a fully developed factory infrastructure. More directly, the military might and winning strategies of the Union army created a series of victories that the South could not overcome. Thus, the majority of modern historians believe that the South was destined to lose the war regardless of any internal successes the Confederacy achieved."

                "paragraph 1": "A billion years ago, the earth’s continents were nearly **devoid** of life. Apart from limited quantities of bacteria and fungi, the land was rocky and barren. The only complex life was underwater. Then, about half a billion years ago, plant life began to appear on the land, eventually covering the surface with soil and producing forests, swamps, and shrublands. **Plants filled the planet with oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, and consequently, animals began to emerge from the depths of the sea.** But where did these land plants come from?",
                "paragraph 2": "Scientists believe that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, which performed photosynthesis long before complex life found its way ashore. Algae are aquatic organisms that are **descended** from single-cell species much like amoeba. These single-cell organisms gained the ability to perform photosynthesis by consuming oceanic bacteria that also had the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.",
                "paragraph 3": "Algae gradually evolved to survive on land. In order to do so, the way that the organisms reproduce changed. Instead of releasing embryos into water, as algae continue to do today, land plants began growing embryos inside themselves. The plants developed a cuticle—a layer that could retain water within the organism—now that **they** no longer had constant direct access to water. Further, plants developed pores in their leaves that allowed them to exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen without losing water. Finally, **vascular tissue** evolved to transport water throughout the plant after receiving it through the roots.",
                "paragraph 4": "There has been some debate as to which freshwater algae species gave rise to land plants. The leading candidate was complex green algae, which resemble plants in that they have long branching bodies. ( A ) However, recent genetic analysis of various algae species revealed that single-cell algae species have much more in common with early species of land plants. ( B ) While this **hypothesis** is difficult to test, researchers now suspect that these simple organisms began to grow outside of ponds and streams, evolving into moss, shrubs, and even trees. ( C ) Thus, the evolution of land plants was more circuitous than scientists had assumed. ( D )"

                "paragraph 1": "Natural diamonds are more expensive than synthetic diamonds, even though they share the same chemical composition; what distinguishes the two is that the former were **forged** millions of years ago in the heat of the earth’s mantle, ascended through volcanic eruption, and were mined in one of three ways: in alluvial mining, where diamonds are sifted from sand in riverbeds and coasts, in underground mining, where explosives are used to extract diamonds in a tunnel, or in marine mining, which utilizes machines to collect diamonds from the ocean floor, whereas synthetic diamonds are grown in a laboratory.",
                "paragraph 2": "It can be impossible to tell a mined diamond from a laboratory-made diamond by looking at it, as with both kinds, the diamond’s quality is appraised by the 4Cs—cut, clarity, carat, and color; a well-cut or faceted diamond sparkles, offering the greatest brilliance and value, and the clarity of the diamond can also affect the brilliance, as naturally occurring imperfections, called inclusions, might obstruct the path of light through a diamond; size is measured in carat weight, where one carat is 200 mg; diamonds may also have color tones, and the rarity of a particular color affects the price of the diamond, with natural blue diamonds being particularly scarce and therefore greatly valued.",
                "paragraph 3": "Synthetic diamonds are colored through a process called irradiation. Irradiated diamonds are colorless diamonds that have been treated with a special combination of radiation and intense heating to bring forth a wide spectrum of rich, fancy colors. The treatment creates a permanent color change, and **it** leaves no harmful traces of radiation on the diamond. Irradiated diamonds have a significantly lower value than naturally occurring colored diamonds, and they can be detected for what they really are through careful analysis in a properly equipped laboratory setting.",
                "paragraph 4": "Much of the cost of synthetic diamonds comes from the expensive process of cutting them. ( A ) Because diamond is the hardest substance, the use of another diamond is required to cut it. ( B ) Diamond cutters in Antwerp first achieved this in 1550. ( C ) Since then, the diamond has become a **fundamental** industrial material used to cut, grind, and polish hard substances. ( D ) In fact, 80 percent of the diamonds mined annually are used in industry, and four times that amount is grown synthetically for industry use—over 500 million carats a year."

But nature seldom progresses that simply. In reality, the cetacean family, which today consists of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, apparently originated some fifty million years ago with a four-legged, wolf-like mammal.",
                "paragraph 2": "In the early 1980s, a team of paleontologists discovered the collection of fossils in the northern part of Pakistan and immediately recognized that **it included** a long skull similar to that of a whale. They named this creature Pakicetus meaning “Pakistan whale.” Later, it was found that the creature’s skull had a bony wall around the inner ear that enabled it to hear underwater. This constituted a striking link between land mammals and **contemporary** whales.",
                "paragraph 3": "**As more fossils were discovered, scientists pieced together the creature’s habitat and means of subsistence.** Pakicetus divided its time between the shore and the sea. Its long legs ended in webbed feet that made it a natural swimmer. It also had powerful teeth that likely gave it the ability to tear the flesh of fish and small animals, which it could reach with a twist of its flexible neck. The animal’s molars showed evidence of scraping that suggests it ground its teeth when it chewed. At the back end of the creature was a long tail.",
                "paragraph 4": "The fossil record suggests that descendants of Pakicetus evolved over the next fifteen million years to enhance their water-friendly features. The webbed feet gradually **morphed** into flippers. Eventually, the aquatic baleen whale emerged. Over a period of about thirty-five million years, whales grew larger and larger, growing from twenty feet to an average of forty feet in length. The increase in size likely occurred so the whales could evade large predators in the sea. (A) Such an occurrence is a common phenomenon in evolution; it is thought that animals that evolve over a long period of time generally tend to get larger. (B) Even so, the process has had an extreme effect on whales. (C) That this monstrous creature is descended from the diminutive Pakicetus is a wonder of nature. (D)"

                "paragraph 1": "Before humans could communicate through speech or written word, there was movement, and with this movement came dance. Yet the changeable nature of dance made it difficult to preserve with accuracy. From toe to toe, hand to hand, and eye to eye, dance has been transmitted from generation to generation. Human chains of dancers, choreographers, and others involved in its creation and performance have passed down their knowledge of specific dances. For a dance to survive the test of time, there must first be people who can appreciate it and then be willing to learn and remember it. Even when these conditions are met, there is little guarantee of accurate preservation, as with each performance the dance may change.",
                "paragraph 2": "Early attempts to preserve dance relied on written descriptions of the movements. Detailed accounts could not, however, accurately capture the subtleties without inviting subjective interpretations. **It is difficult to express in words the form a dancer must assume when jumping or spinning, and harder still to understand these words without having seen the dance.** Several attempts were made at creating a system of notation for dance, similar to that in music. The first successful system of notation was Labanotation, developed in 1928 by a dance theorist Rudolf von Laban. The system uses symbols to represent all aspects of human motion, from subtle gestures to transference of weight. Most variations of Labanotation, such as Motif Notation, are simplifications of this method. However, Sutton **DanceWriting** is a distinct system that uses stick figures to depict motion. The problem with all of these two-dimensional systems of notation is that no matter how intricate they are, they cannot capture the full extent of three-dimensional movement.",
                "paragraph 3": "Graphical methods have also been employed to record dance. ( A ) Recently, video has become the standard for recording any dance, as the dance in its entirety can be captured in real time. ( B ) However, video can only offer one perspective of the dance at one time **that of the** cameraperson’s. ( C ) Even with multiple angles, the medium is still in essence two-dimensional. ( D ) Video also requires expensive equipment and careful preservation, as the tapes may **deteriorate** with time. Any method of recording dance takes place from the viewpoint of the person recording the dance, and can never be a substitute for knowledge or experience."

                "paragraph 1": "Approximately half of the 9,000 existing species of birds learn how to sing. There are many similarities between the learning process of songbirds and language acquisition in human beings. Both seem to involve an **innate** predisposition to learn a method of communication that is shaped by social influences.",
                "paragraph 2": "Infant songbirds raised in soundproofed chambers in a laboratory emitted a crude but recognizable song that contained elements similar to those of the normal song. Scientists postulated that birds are born with a basic template of what their species’ song should sound like. **They** match this template to the song they hear around them during development until the song they produce is perfected. An **isolated bird** does not hear the normal song, and so it can only produce the crude template. Young birds prefer to learn the songs of their parents but will learn the songs of other species if the song of their own species is not heard during this critical period.",
                "paragraph 3": "Young birds that learn a song through electronic mediums, such as cassette tapes and CDs, have a greater tendency to **incorporate** notes used by other species in the final adult song if they hear a live tutor of another species. **They are even capable of ignoring the electronic song of the same species and learning the song of a different species if the live tutor of another species is present in the same environment.** This occurs during the **sensorimotor** phase, when the bird is comparing and practicing the sounds it heard previously.",
                "paragraph 4": "After much practice and experimentation, the final adult song is established. (A) There are always individual variations that depend on the genetic ability of each individual, as well as the capacity for the individuals to absorb and remember the musical notes heard. (B) As long as they are exposed to an adequate stimulus, all young birds learn how to sing. (C) It is important to note that the process of learning does not end once a bird is fully grown.

                "paragraph 1": "The nobility of Renaissance Italy entertained important visitors with music, mime, and dance. These court shows, called **spectacles**, were magnificent celebrations that often included hundreds of performers. Florentine noblewoman Catherine de’ Medici brought court dancing with her to France when she married King Henry II. During this period, Catherine commissioned a spectacle for the celebration of the marriage of the Duke of Joyeuse to Marguerite of Lorraine. **This** is looked upon as the birth of ballet. It was an epic piece that lasted over five hours and, unlike modern ballet, included elements of vocal performance.",
                "paragraph 2": "Another influential figure in the development of ballet was King Louis XIV of France, who began the **transition** of the dance from court entertainment to a profession. Interested in ballet from an early age, Louis encouraged others to work at perfecting the art and making dance respectable. Louis performed in ballets with roles considered worthy of his exalted position. Foremost among these was the Ballet de la Nuit, in which he appeared as the Sun King, also a nickname he gave himself. His court devoted much of their energy to dance, achieving greater **proficiency** in both choreography and composition. In 1661, Louis formally established ballet as a professional theatrical art when he created the Royal Academy of the Dance, the world’s first ballet school. Past his physical prime, Louis retired in 1669, allowing more capable and talented dancers to take lead roles.",
                "paragraph 3": "By the late seventeenth century, the foundations of modern ballet were established. Ballet masters began to codify their teaching methods by systemizing the five foot positions of ballet and by making attempts to create a dance notation similar to that of music. ( A ) In addition, costumes were adapted to allow for more intricate footwork, and the ballerina, the female dancer, achieved greater renown. ( B ) Up to this time, many restrictions were placed on the art of ballet. ( C ) Free-flowing movements, jumps, and lifts were considered socially unacceptable. ( D ) Variations for effect could be made only through changing floor patterns or tempo. At this time, ballet continued to be a combination of dance, singing, and music, with the emphasis usually on singing. **By 1760, however, ballet masters began to question the unwanted restrictions and rigid protocol of their art left over from the days when it was part of court entertainment.**"

This bubble of gases, which extends from the planet’s surface, is held together by gravity. **While an atmosphere seems to be a requirement for life, having one does not guarantee that life will develop.** In determining the viability of life on a particular planet, some key considerations are the atmosphere’s temperature, gaseous composition, and density. These factors help to explain why Earth is **teeming** with life and why its neighbor Mars appears to be barren.",
                "paragraph 2": "Whereas Earth retains precious warmth because it has a greenhouse atmosphere that traps the heat emanating from its surface, Mars has a much weaker greenhouse effect. Earth consequently maintains a 59-degree average temperature at **its** surface, while Mars averages a deadly minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Mars’s temperatures also fluctuate much more widely than Earth’s, ranging at the equator from 70 degrees during the day to minus 100 degrees at night.",
                "paragraph 3": "The greenhouse effect is created by the presence of the planet’s atmosphere. ( A ) Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide absorb the Sun’s radiation, capturing heat like a blanket over the planet. ( B ) These gases do not have to dominate the atmospheric composition to create a greenhouse effect. ( C ) Mars’s atmosphere is 95 percent carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and Earth’s is 71 percent nitrogen, which is not a greenhouse gas. ( D ) So why does Mars have a weaker greenhouse effect?",
                "paragraph 4": "The reason is the density of Mars’s atmosphere, which is 100 times thinner than Earth’s. This thin atmosphere provides little protection against radiation from the constant **impact** of space particles like solar winds and cosmic rays. However, this may not have been the case billions of years ago. The evidence accumulated by robotic and aerial space missions supports the hypothesis that Mars once had water flowing on its surface. If so, Mars probably had a thicker atmosphere that may have been stripped away by solar winds or by a collision with a large space object. Fortunately for the 8.7 million species on Earth, our atmosphere is protected from solar winds by a robust magnetic field, a feature that Mars lacks."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "Since their domestication around 4000 BC, horses have been employed by humans for a variety of purposes, including for food, transportation, and agriculture. With wooden and metal devices attached to their bodies, these large mammals are able to cultivate farmland at speeds that **surpass** human capabilities. Their strong tractive force significantly boosts the rate at which a field can be prepared or harvested. However, their use as agricultural tools took place gradually and changed over time.",
                "paragraph 2": "At first, oxen were traditionally favored by humans as they shifted towards agrarian societies. Oxen have a greater muscle mass and can pull heavier weights than horses, although they are considerably slower. Due to this early preference, the yoke for fieldwork was designed for bovine anatomy rather than **that** of a horse. Attempts to make yokes more suitable for horses began with the invention of the Chinese breast-strap in 481 BC, an innovation that was eventually introduced to Europe and **modified** into a full-throat collar. By AD 1100, the full-throat collar lacked the original torso straps and instead consisted of a pair of curved wooden pieces that were tied together with leather. These were thickly padded underneath, which reduced the pressure on the animal’s windpipe by spreading the weight of a pulled load evenly across its shoulders. These changes allowed horses to apply 50 percent more power to any given task compared to previous collars.",
                "paragraph 3": "The social and economic effects of this development in medieval Europe were far-reaching. A direct result was an increase in the efficiency and crop yields of peasant farmers. **While horses necessitated time-consuming care, as their hooves required fitted shoes and careful cleaning, their faster pace made them more profitable than oxen.** This improvement stimulated the European economy, as farmers became wealthy and began to specialize in other areas, such as trade. Additionally, the food surplus from larger crop yields allowed populations to expand, as small farms could support greater numbers of people than in earlier eras.",
                "paragraph 4": "Despite its benefits, the era of efficient horse-driven farming eventually came to an end. This was initially due to the advent of the steam engine in the United Kingdom in the 1840s. ( A ) Over time, steam-powered harvesting machines gained popularity. ( B ) Similarly, tractors rapidly gained dominance on American farms with the spread of mechanization in the 1940s and started to replace horses. ( C ) Cheap fuel costs and low-interest federal loans enabled American farmers to invest in modern technology, resulting in animals being almost entirely phased out of agriculture. ( D )",
                "paragraph 5": "In recent years, following the widespread interest in environmental protection and energy conservation, smallholding farmers have been returning to the use of horses as farming tools, leading to a revival in horse-based agriculture. Advocates proclaim that horses are inexpensive as they eat grass and require less maintenance. In contrast, tractors require constant refueling, recurrent maintenance, and costly part replacements. Moreover, although the animals have a lower efficiency than tractors, they do not emit noxious gases."

        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "Nestling birds are completely dependent on their parents for survival, so nature has favored those who are extremely vocal and demonstrative in signaling that food is required. When they are hungry, most baby birds turn their heads to the sky and open their beaks wide, sending an unmistakable message: “Feed me.” In response, parent birds drop food into the gaping jaws of their offspring, whether that food is a regurgitated earlier meal or a fresh-picked insect. Sometimes there is enough food to satisfy the entire brood, but if there isn’t, feeding adults are forced to make difficult choices.",
                "paragraph 2": "Parental responses to begging behavior vary depending on the species. Tree swallows, for instance, follow the old adage “the squeaky wheel gets the grease,” feeding the most **vigorous** beggars more than their quiet siblings. In contrast, hoopoe mothers pay no attention to the begging and simply provide more food for the bigger chicks. In some species, avian fathers share feeding duties with their female partners, and the provisioning strategies can differ based on the sex of the parent. Zebra finch fathers are inclined to distribute supplies on a first come, first served basis, while the mothers tend to select the chicks they wish to feed and stick to that choice regardless of which chicks are first in line. On the other hand, in families of sociable weavers (a southern African species), parental gender has little or no impact on a parent’s response to begging.",
                "paragraph 3": "One study of begging behavior revealed that parental feeding choices are dependent on the family’s environmental context. A team from the University of Oxford compiled the results of 306 studies spanning 143 different bird species. They found that in optimal conditions—when a stable supply of food is available—parents favor loud beggars, presumably taking begging as a sign of greater need. But in lean times, adult birds will provide nourishment to the larger chicks. **This decision** is apparently strategic, based on the assumption that more mature babies have a better chance of survival whereas louder, smaller chicks may not make it anyway.",
                "paragraph 4": "Tending to hungry young birds places a heavy burden on the parents, demanding energy that is equivalent to that expended by a human in a major bicycle race. For that reason, some bird species forgo the taxing process of caring for their own young altogether. For instance, brood parasites like indigobirds and whydahs place their young in the nests of rival species, effectively outsourcing **their** parental duties. (A) The parasitic babies mimic the begging behavior and even the mouth markings of the species that owns the nest. (B) The host parents are fooled and raise the little intruders as if they were their own. (C) Brood parasites typically grow faster and push the other young birds out of the nest. (D)"

            {
                "paragraph 1": "Scientists have identified five mass extinction events that occurred over the course of Earth’s history, with the best-known being the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Before the dinosaurs emerged, though, an even more devastating extinction event wiped out 95 percent of marine species and 70 percent of terrestrial vertebrates. The end-Permian extinction event, unofficially known as the Great Dying, occurred about 250 million years ago. **The damage may have spanned only 100,000 years, a mere blink of the eye in geological time, particularly considering that it took 10 million years for the planet to recover what it lost in biodiversity.** However, while the disappearance of millions of species is clearly documented in the fossil record, the causes of the die-off between the Permian and Triassic periods are not well understood.",
                "paragraph 2": "Some scientists believe that the cause of the two mass extinction events mentioned above was the same: massive asteroids colliding with Earth. In 2004, a 75-mile crater was discovered buried off the shore of Australia that dates back to the late Permian period. **This Bedout crater is similar in size to the Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico that is considered prime evidence that the dinosaur extinction was caused by an asteroid.** An asteroid impact as large as this could have produced an enormous cloud of particles that would have blocked the Sun for months, causing temperatures to fall. Acid rain would have followed, and the combination of total darkness, sudden cold, and **this** would have destroyed most of the plant life that herbivores required for survival. In turn, the death of the herbivores would have led to the death of the carnivores that ate them. However, other experts contest the asteroid hypothesis, contending that the Bedout structure is not an impact crater after all.",
                "paragraph 3": "A less dramatic explanation is based on signs of oxygen depletion in rocks formed underwater 20 during the Permian period. (A) This hypothesis suggests that the mass death of marine life was due to low oxygen levels in shallow waters brought on by the absence of polar ice caps. (B) There might have been a buildup of carbon dioxide in the Permian oceans, which would have gradually poisoned sea life. (C) However, proponents of the oxygen deprivation hypothesis are unsure of the catalyst for these changes. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "One potential catalyst is widespread volcanic activity in present-day Siberia. Numerous erupting Siberian volcanoes could have covered the planet in hot lava, filling the atmosphere with volcanic gases and producing acid rain, just as in the asteroid scenario. The resulting fires and decay would have filled the air with greenhouse gases and have heated the world beyond a **hospitable** level for the world’s animals. The volcano theory remains the most popular explanation for the Great Dying."

The twenty-year-old ruler inherited a collection of Greek city-states that had already been united by his father, Philip II, and he aspired to add to that kingdom. Influenced by his childhood teacher, the great Greek philosopher Aristotle, Alexander was determined to spread Greek culture throughout the world. To do that, however, he knew that he would have to respect the cultures of the states he conquered. By balancing these two seemingly conflicting goals, Alexander was able to build the most expansive empire the world had ever seen.",
                "paragraph 2": "After Philip II was assassinated by a royal bodyguard, Alexander’s first aim was to fulfill his father’s dream of defeating the Persian Empire. The Persians controlled a vast territory from the Balkans to Pakistan and had attempted to take over the Greek states. In 334 BC, Alexander invaded cities in the western portion of modern-day Turkey, cutting off the Persians from their naval bases. The next year, he defeated Darius III of Persia in a battle near modern Syria despite being badly outnumbered. From the beginning, Alexander showed great respect for Persian culture by wearing Persian clothes, adopting many of Persian customs, and acknowledging the right of defeated leaders to continue to run day- to-day affairs. He was so zealous in his acceptance of his enemy’s ways that some of his companions began to resent him for it.",
                "paragraph 3": "Alexander then marched into northern Africa and conquered Egypt, once a leading world power. He asked to be crowned pharaoh, which won him the favor of the Egyptian public as well as the priests. Using this political capital to **propagate** his own culture, he founded the Greek-style city of Alexandria, which featured a Greek theater, a Greek gymnasium, and became famous for its vast Greek library. With this done, Alexander moved his army into the Punjab region of India. In 326 BC, he met King Porus of Paurava in battle. It was the first time the Macedonian emperor had ever encountered an army flanked by elephants. He ordered that the massive animals be attacked with javelins, but that only created a chaotic scene in which both armies were trampled. In the end, however, Porus’s inexperienced soldiers were no match for Alexander’s professional warriors. Alexander agreed to treat Porus like a king, once again gaining political advantage by adopting a respectful attitude toward his enemies.",
                "paragraph 4": "The great warrior-king died at the age of 32, perhaps the victim of malaria, assassination by a rival who wanted to take over his empire, or overconsumption of wine, but the Greek influence that Alexander the Great brought to the far reaches of the world known to him lasted for centuries. He had accomplished both of his primary goals, spreading Greek ideas while allowing the territories he conquered with his armies to retain **their** essential characteristics."

                "paragraph 1": "Audio and video reproduction both became possible in the same burst of invention that took place\nin the late nineteenth century. However, despite the efforts of Thomas Edison and others, it soon became conventional wisdom that sound and film were incompatible. And the film industry did not seem to need sound. In the early 1900s, Hollywood managed to become the cultural and commercial hub it is today thanks to silent films with soundtracks provided by local theater musicians.",
                "paragraph 2": "Without the benefit of human voices, silent movies had developed into an art form characterized by broad, crowd-pleasing spectacle. Although silent films often included title cards with dialogue or exposition, these took up the entire screen and slowed down the action. To keep the public entertained, silent movies were mostly wordless and full of simple situations that could be taken in at a glance. Words were not essential to understanding the death-defying stunts of action-adventure pictures, nor were they necessary to interpret the exaggerated facial expressions and slapstick physicality of comedies",
                "paragraph 3": "Even as audio technology improved, major studios were reluctant to alter their winning formula. So it makes sense that the first one to match human voices to the action on screen was the relatively obscure Warner Brothers Studios in 1926. But even Warner Brothers mainly conceived of this as a way of adding music and comedy. At first, Vitaphone, the amplified sound system they licensed from Western Electric, was used to show brief vaudeville stage performances in which entertainers sang songs and told jokes directly to the camera, but **these** were shown only during interludes between silent movies. Only after 1927’s The Jazz Singer, a full-length movie including some recorded music and a few pieces of dialogue, proved to be a surprise success at the box office did studios consider synchronizing speech throughout entire motion pictures.",
                "paragraph 4": "Despite a steady stream of production in the late 1920s and early 1930s, movies with sound—or talkies as they came to be called—did not dominate the market quickly. (A) Purists insisted that this new form of cinema was an inferior product and a cheap gimmick. (B) Primitive microphones required actors to remain stationary onscreen. (C) This made for **listless** scenes with little action, and 25 the problem was worsened by the fact that the loud whir of cameras meant camera operators had to remain inside a box to baffle the sound. (D) It also proved to be a major career obstacle for some popular actors whose voices did not match their looks. Moreover, the now-overworked projectionists struggled to keep the audio synchronized, as they had to drop a needle onto a record player when changing reels—and the audience erupted in boos whenever their timing was off. It would take years 30 of improvements to camera systems, microphones, and projectors before talkies replaced silent films at the cinema."

                "paragraph 1": "Before Albert Einstein, scientists like Sir Isaac Newton erroneously assumed that the universe was flat. However, in his theory of general relativity, Einstein proposed that the universe was in fact dynamic and could be bent, stretched, and curved like **rubber or plastic**. In this view of the universe, the combination of space, time, and gravity determines where matter exists and how it moves relative\nto other objects. Later, modern astronomers took Einstein’s theory further and **surmised** that it might be possible for matter to traverse great distances in space much more quickly than would normally be expected. The mechanism by which this could be achieved is known as a wormhole, which is defined\nas a hypothetical shortcut between two points that are otherwise far more remote from one another in time and space.",
                "paragraph 2": "According to contemporary science, the formation of a wormhole depends on a relationship between a black hole and a white hole, the former of which is an extremely dense area of space that emits no light and from which nothing can escape. The lesser-known white hole is exactly the opposite, meaning that it is extremely bright and that matter rushes out of it in a constant stream.\nIn theory, a wormhole could form between these two entities, connecting them and creating a portal through which an object could move. This would generate a pathway between two points in space, and it would allow for the possibility of them being much closer to each other than they are in normal space and time outside the wormhole. To visualize this, imagine a long piece of paper that is bent so that the two ends are parallel, one above the other. Near each end, there is a hole in the paper, and these openings are connected by a short tube. The distance between the two holes is shorter when measured through the tube than it is along the surface of the bent piece of paper. In this scenario, the paper represents space, the openings a black hole and white hole, and the tube a wormhole.",
                "paragraph 3": "Although the wormhole theory is fascinating and has attracted the attention of numerous astronomers and enthusiasts, it is not without some serious problems. (A) Ignoring the fact that the observation of black and white holes is still fraught with difficulty, current analytics in physics suggest that if a wormhole were possible, it would vanish very quickly after formation. (B) In fact, it would dissipate so rapidly that there would most likely be insufficient time for anything to pass through.(C) Even so, some researchers have theorized that it may be possible at some point in the future to stabilize wormholes for utilization in space travel.

                "paragraph 1": "During World War II, the Allied and Axis powers both attempte to develop effective ways to communicate without the enemy gaining knowledge of the content of their messages. When successful, this strategy allowed them to securely send memos about the details of military operations. Some security measures included coded messages, and the most famous of these was implemented by Nazi Germany with an encryption device called an Enigma machine. Before it was eventually decoded, the Enigma machine was considered to be a completely secure method of communication.",
                "paragraph 2": "Although the Enigma machine had more than one design, a typical one might be described as a typewriter with some additional features. Viewed from above, at the bottom of the device’s surface was a keyboard, with each key representing a letter of the alphabet. Above the keyboard was a set\nof lights. These corresponded to a letter, and the letters were in the same layout. Above the lights, there were three thumb-movable wheels called rotors, which, from right to left, were designated fast, medium, and slow. Each rotor contained twenty-six electrical contacts on one side, and these were wired to twenty-six letters on the other side, and each rotor could be manually set to any letter at any time. When an operator pressed a key, the right rotor advanced with every typed character, while the middle rotor advanced once per twenty-six characters, and the left rotor moved forward only once per 676 characters. Moving any of the three rotors resulted in a continual reordering of the letters of the alphabet, so this arrangement created a seemingly **boundless** combination of possible outputs.",
                "paragraph 3": "As electrical signals moved through the three rotors, they encountered an electronic reflector, which redirected the current back through the rotors in the opposite direction. However, the wiring was set up so that the current went back through a separate route. For instance, if an operator pressed\nA, the signal might go through A, P and Z, then the reflector might redirect the current through the Z, G and B contacts on its way back through the rotors. In this example, B would be the ciphertext, or encrypted text, form of A, and the B light would illuminate. If A was pressed a second time, a completely different sequence would be produced for the following route.",
                "paragraph 4": "An Enigma machine’s electrical circuit was perfectly symmetrical. Consequently, when using two machines that were configured in an identical manner, a message could be encrypted on one machine and readily decrypted on the other. The symmetry was convenient for anyone who had the key to the configuration because the receiver could quickly decipher the message without further conversion or interpretation. However, it also made the Enigma machine more vulnerable, and this weakness was exploited by the Allied Polish and British cryptographers who ultimately broke its mysterious codes."

        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "The first fully mechanical clocks in Europe were developed in the thirteenth century, and the earliest of these were known as verge-and-foliot clocks. The verge was a vertical rod, and the foliot was a horizontal bar that was affixed to the top of the verge. On each end of the foliot, adjustable weights could be placed to keep the bar in balance and alter the distance that it moved. The other major parts of this early design were toothed wheels (gearwheels), which turned as the foliot moved back and forth like a horizontal seesaw.",
                "paragraph 2": "Normally, suspended weights accelerate with each movement. However, the verge-and-foliot system prevented this natural acceleration so that the foliot would move at a slow, uniform speed. This allowed the teeth of the wheels to move at regular intervals, with each release or “escape” of the gearwheel representing the equivalent of one tick of the clock. A device that transfers energy to intermittently **impede** and release a counting mechanism like a gearwheel is known as an escapement. Although the verge-and-foliot escapement was a significant improvement over prior timekeeping technologies like sundials, it was only precise enough to mark the hours. Improvements had to be made for clocks to be accurate at the level of minutes and seconds.",
                "paragraph 3": "The first major step in this direction was the invention of the pendulum. A pendulum consists of a vertical rod, which is attached to a pivot, and a suspended weight attached to the bottom of the rod. When set in motion, a pendulum continues to swing back and forth on its own. The time a pendulum takes to make one complete cycle is its period, and the period depends solely on the length of the rod rather than the mass of the weight. In many pendulum clocks, an anchor escapement was used. It was named for its shape as it looked like a marine anchor. The top of an anchor escapement was typically shaped like an upside-down V with a sharp inward-directed point on each end of the “legs.” Attached to the center was a pendulum, and as the pendulum swung, the two points alternately caught and released the teeth of a rotating gearwheel.",
                "paragraph 4": "Over time, clockmakers learned to modify pendulum clocks in order to continually increase their precision. Through experiments, they discovered that a pendulum must be 0.994 meters in length to create a period of exactly two seconds so that each swing lasted precisely one second. Another innovation occurred after the realization that pendulum clocks ran slower in summer and faster in winter due to the expansion and contraction of the metal rod, causing the loss of up to one second per week during the warm season. To compensate for this, metal rods were replaced with wooden ones. Eventually, these and other improvements led to the development of pendulum clocks that fluctuated by as little as one second per year, so they rarely needed adjustment."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "The late eighteenth century was known as the Age of Revolutions as social and political upheavals, such as the American and French Revolutions, dramatically changed the way Western people viewed their societies and the world. After centuries in which monarchs ruled, the people turned to more democratic forms of government. The development of a revolutionary spirit also occurred in literature and the arts when a generation of intellectuals and artists began to challenge the literary and artistic trends of the previous centuries. From the end of the eighteenth century and well into the nineteenth century, this generation inspired the ideas behind the movement known as Romanticism.",
                "paragraph 2": "Advocates of Romanticism strongly prioritized the role of imagination over reason and logic. They believed that imagination was the principal creative force of humans and that it was the most essential element for understanding ourselves and the world around us. In the words of the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth, humans not only discern the world but also help to form it. In this sense, the human ability to imagine things is similar to a god’s or deity’s capacity to create the universe. Imagination is how human beings interpret their experiences, and then it is up to the Romantic artist or writer to create works based on this.",
                "paragraph 3": "Another central feature of Romanticism was the focus on subjective individualism and freedom. (A) This emphasis was clearly in line with the revolutionary spirit of the times, in which liberalism was gaining substantial momentum. (B) With regard to the arts, this meant that the artist or writer should be free of the restraints of convention. (C) Therefore, Romanticism represented a strong objection to the obsession with standardized beauty in Neoclassicism and the insistence on reason in the Enlightenment as it highlighted subjectivity, **disdain** for conformity to rules, and the supremacy of bold individualism. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "To pursue the ideal of individualism, many Romantics experimented with a solitary life away from society in order to gain greater self-awareness and a stronger connection to nature. The practice of meditating, writing, and painting outdoors became a major trend of the period. Indeed, the Romantics venerated nature in a way that previous generations had not. Rather than passively accepting man’s control over the environment as was the tendency during the Industrial Revolution, Romantic intellectuals sought to elevate the natural world to a higher status, even equal with or above that of mankind. This aspect of Romanticism inspired similar movements, such as Transcendentalism, that added an even deeper spiritual and moral character to Romanticism. Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson believed that God could be found in nature and that the human soul’s striving to become one with God and nature was the highest form of spiritual attainment."

(C) Chronic sufferers experience a range of related physical and mental health problems, such as depression or addiction to drugs prescribed to induce sleep. (D)",
                "paragraph 3": "Doctors have documented common factors that contribute to insomnia, which tend to fall into predictable categories. Physiological causes may be related to the consumption of stimulants, like **caffeine and nicotine**; these alter the level of certain chemicals in the nervous system, making it difficult for the brain to shut down and enter a proper sleep cycle. The disruption of the circadian rhythm, the natural timing of human sleeping and waking, can also contribute to insomnia. **Disruption of the circadian rhythm can occur when, for instance, a person must adjust to a new environment after traveling across several time zones on an airplane, referred to colloquially as “jet lag,” or when employment requires shift work that takes place in irregular patterns.**",
                "paragraph 4": "Psychological factors, however, have been shown to be the more likely cause for extended periods of insomnia as opposed to physiological determinants. Feelings of stress and anxiety are the best documented causes, arising from a number of sources. Young adults, for example, may experience severe pressure to balance academic responsibilities, after-school activities, and personal relationships. This can make it challenging to calm down before bedtime and successfully fall asleep.",
                "paragraph 5": "Insomnia can also be related to more serious psychological ailments, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. In this case, the inability to sleep is related to the insomniac being regularly troubled by memories of past trauma, which resurface in the form of nightmares and flashbacks. The sufferer will either attempt to avert such negative reactions by avoiding sleep altogether or be constantly interrupted while trying to rest. He or she may also develop an excessive startle response that prevents continuous sleep for the extended period of time necessary to (rejuvenate) the body."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) includes a range of technologies designed to create direct communication channels between a human brain and a computer. **The primary goal of BCI is to develop ways for humans to control devices or tools using brain signals only, capabilities that not only would help scientists better understand the human brain but also would offer opportunities for people who have severe physical disabilities but normal cognitive functions**. For example, someone who has been paralyzed in an automobile accident might be able to operate a wheelchair even though the person cannot move his or her arms and hands.",
                "paragraph 2": "Currently, there are two main categories of brain-computer interface systems, noninvasive and invasive. A common noninvasive technique **entails** the use of an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is a test that detects changes in brain waves. In this method, small metal discs called electrodes are pasted onto the scalp, and electrical signals from the brain are measured and recorded. Conversely, an invasive BCI procedure implants tiny electrodes directly into the brain during neurosurgery, which is costlier and riskier for the patient. However, the benefit is that invasive electrodes produce a much higher graphic resolution and are more specific as each electrode can target a single neuron.",
                "paragraph 3": "In either case, the electrodes are wired to an external computer for processing, which typically requires several steps in which the brain’s electrical signals are interpreted, classified, and translated using mathematical formulas. (A) This processing is necessary in order to discover what kind of mental task the subject is performing so that the data can be converted into a digital command. (B) Once a digital command is generated, it is transmitted to an external device in an attempt to achieve a corresponding action, such as the movement of a cursor or a robotic arm. (C) The success or failure of an intended action is determined by the feedback returned to the user from the device. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "Although the notion of harnessing the brain’s neuron activity dates to the 1960s, practical scientific applications of BCI technology are still in their infancy. One reason is that the brain’s electrical signals are different across individuals, so the creation of universal digital output commands is not feasible. Moreover, in BCI, the process is not merely a one-way stream of information from the brain to the external environment. In fact, the brain’s neurons are malleable and must adapt in response to the BCI environment. Each subject, often through trial and error, still must learn how to think in a particular way so that the electrical signals and digital commands can successfully achieve the intended task. Thus, a one-size-fits-all approach to BCI may never come to **fruition**, and third-party mediation between subjects and computers remains important. In this sense, even though BCI is a high-tech undertaking, the process is similar to that of an injured athlete undergoing rehabilitation with the aid and guidance of a licensed physical therapist."

        "title": "Factors in Jellyfish Population Growth",
        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "Jellyfish are a broad group of sea creatures that includes over 2,000 species of gelatinous zooplankton. These unusual creatures lack most of the vital organs that are considered important for animal survival. Yet, their simple physiology allows them to adapt to a wide variety of conditions. This adaptability has enabled their numbers to rise despite factors like pollution and climate change.",
                "paragraph 2": "Scientists posit that carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution plays a considerable role in the population growth of jellyfish. CO2 emissions have steadily altered temperatures through global warming. This process restricts the escape of heat from the atmosphere, warming the air and water. Researchers have discovered that warmer water results in an increase in the population size of many types of jellyfish because it enables them to reproduce for longer periods of the year and to generate more offspring. Moreover, global warming results in the increased acidification of the oceans, as atmospheric CO2 dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. Acid lowers the pH of the water to a level that can be fatal to many organisms. For example, it diminishes the survival rate of fish larvae by removing their ability to smell, making them vulnerable to predators. **However, for jellyfish, high acidity seems to have little impact, and, with less biological diversity due to the die-offs of other creatures, jellyfish can become dominant in the ecosystem.**",
                "paragraph 3": "The excessive fertilization of agricultural crops can also positively affect the jellyfish population through eutrophication, wherein fertilizer runoff eventually ends up in a water source. In this process, the overly nutritious water generates dense plant growth by providing a fresh source of nitrogen. (A) This can **provoke** an algae bloom on the water’s surface, creating a problem when a large population of algae reproduces and dies, sinking to the sea floor. (B) The abnormal volume of algae decomposition then depletes the oxygen supply, thereby suffocating the oxygen-dependent species and forming dead zones. (C) Jellyfish, however, have a high tolerance to low-oxygen conditions, meaning that they can survive in areas where eutrophication has taken place. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "In addition, overfishing reduces the innate predation and competition that keep jellyfish populations in check and prevent their spread to new territory. Commercial fishing continues to remove great numbers of the large fish that are the primary predators of jellyfish. It also harvests small fish like anchovies, which are major competitors of jellyfish as they depend upon the same food resources. The removal of these species encourages the proliferation of jellyfish. For example, industrial fishing in the Black Sea in the 1980s led to an **irreversible** decline in mackerel and bluefish, the fish that feed on jellyfish in the region. This resulted in a massive explosion in the number of jellyfish; in fact, it is now common for many coastal areas of the Black Sea to be inundated with millions of jellyfish at certain times of year."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "Blaise Pascal, a gifted mathematician and inventor, was the son of a tax collector in a small town in southern France. To assist his father in his work, he devised a simple adding machine consisting of ten numbered wheels linked by gears. Called the Pascaline, this first mechanical calculator could add and subtract numbers up to eight digits long. Although offering a substantial improvement over manual calculations, the machine was considered expensive and unreliable, and only Pascal himself had the knowledge to make the necessary repairs if it malfunctioned. In addition, accountants discouraged the use of the machine for fear of losing their jobs. Despite these issues, Pascal’s innovative device laid the groundwork for future devices and was the precursor to **the modern computer**.",
                "paragraph 2": "The Burroughs adding machine, named after its inventor William Seward Burroughs, was built and patented in 1885. This adding machine required users to pull a handle in order to **execute** a calculation. Novice users would get wildly differing sums depending on the amount of force they applied to **it**. The design flaws and prohibitive cost of the original machines led to commercial failure, and the first 50 were recalled. Burroughs, however, continued working on an improved calculating machine, which incorporated the use of a hydraulic governor. (A) This component enabled the machine to operate properly regardless of the manner in which the handle was pulled. (B) The machine caught on with businesses, and sales had climbed dramatically by the turn of the century. (C) Later models would include electronic motors to replace the hand-driven cranks. (D) Depressible keys were also added to this second-generation model, and it had the ability to print its calculations on paper.",
                "paragraph 3": "In 1887, a young mechanic named Dorr Felt developed the first practical calculator to use a keyboard, named the Comptometer. His design was based on a carry mechanism that was fast enough to allow the keys to return to their original state after being depressed and a lever to clear calculations. Though exceedingly fast and reliable, these machines had to be used by an expert who was specially trained in their operation. **The machine was produced for over 40 years because of its unique capabilities, and a number of improvements were made to it during this time.**",
                "paragraph 4": "Fail-safe keys locked the machine, which prevented a partial press from generating errors as it would have in earlier models. An unlimited number of keys could also be pressed, allowing for faster calculations. Another feature, called a duplex design, held a running total in a second set of dial wheels while the primary wheels continued to add, and subtotal amounts that could be transferred at any time to the running total."

            {
                "paragraph 1": "Although scientists continue to debate the **extent** and implications of global warming, they all agree that the phenomenon is real and will have a significant impact on the world’s oceans. The most obvious concern is that the melting of the polar ice caps will cause sea levels to rise dramatically, creating a risk of flooding in coastal regions. However, a much more serious threat is the potential for the interruption of the system of currents that transports water throughout the planet’s oceans.",
                "paragraph 2": "Oceanic currents can be divided into two main types: surface and deep-water. Surface currents are primarily driven by the prevailing winds, such as the air masses that move constantly eastward in the tropical and polar regions, and the **ones** that travel westward in the middle latitudes. Deep-water currents are an outcome of what is known as thermohaline circulation—a term derived from the Greek words thermo and haline, meaning \"heat\" and \"salinity\" respectively. **As the name suggests, thermohaline circulation is dependent on variations in the temperature and salt content of seawater, with the density of water increasing as it becomes colder and saltier.** At a certain point, it will sink to the ocean floor, displacing the water below. These two types of currents working in unison cause vast quantities of seawater to travel immense distances in a fixed pattern, a process that has come to be known as the global ocean conveyor belt.",
                "paragraph 3": "When tracking this network of currents, scientists typically begin in the North Atlantic, where freezing temperatures lead to ice formation. Ice does not include salt, so the cold seawater that remains has a very high salinity and, as a result, is very dense. When it **inevitably** sinks, it pushes the water already present in the deep Atlantic south until it reaches Antarctica and begins to move eastward along the continental shelf. Eventually, this water flows north into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, where it mixes with warmer, less salty water and begins to rise to the surface. At this point, it comes under the influence of wind currents, such as **the Gulf Stream**, and is carried back up to the North Atlantic, where it starts the entire journey again.",
                "paragraph 4": "(A) The global ocean conveyor belt is critically important to the overall health of the planet, as the constant movement and mixing of warm and cold water regulates the global climate and transports nutrients that are vital for marine life. (B) Unfortunately, there is a significant chance that global warming may interrupt this network of currents. (C) The main issue is that the ongoing melting of the ice cap in the northern hemisphere is resulting in massive quantities of freshwater entering the North Atlantic. (D) In response, the seawater is becoming less salty and, therefore, less dense. If this continues to the point that the incoming seawater no longer descends to the ocean floor, the thermohaline current may cease to exist, causing the global ocean conveyor belt to break down completely."

        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "For over two millennia, artists and art critics have discussed and debated the theory of art put forward in Aristotle’s Poetics, in which the philosopher described art as \"following the pattern of nature.\" Aristotle’s interpretation of the Greek term mimesis (usually translated as \"imitation\") has been at the center of the discussion. **A prevalent assumption among art critics has been that Aristotle used mimesis in a single literal sense to show that genuine art should replicate nature, but this view fails to capture the dual meaning of his theory as he also likened the make-believe of children to the creative intent of artists.**",
                "paragraph 2": "Still, many Renaissance artists inherited the strict interpretation of Greek mimesis, as demonstrated by their love of the story of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, two ancient Greek artists. According to Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder, Zeuxis and Parrhasius held a competition to determine who the greater artist was between them. When Zeuxis **unveiled** his painting of grapes, birds descended from the sky and began trying to consume them. The birds were thus deceived by the realistic portrayal of the fruit. Proud of this result, Zeuxis promptly asked that the curtain be removed from Parrhasius’s painting, but no sooner than he had made his request, he realized that the curtain was part of the painting.",
                "paragraph 3": "This story was popular in the Netherlands during the seventeenth century, and its direct influence is apparent in some Dutch paintings of the period. Adrian van der Spelt, for instance, used a similar motif in his Flower Still Life with Curtain, which realistically displayed a curtain pulled to the side of the canvas as if to reveal the painting behind **it**. Many other Dutch still lifes were equally lifelike, and a fashionable trend at the time was for artists to attempt to generate a perception of illusion. (A) To a casual viewer, most Dutch still lifes would seem purely imitative; but a closer observation reveals they included symbolic elements. (B) Though the subjects of paintings often included tangible items, the objects were not merely depictions of nature. (C) The presence of burning candles or hourglasses, for instance, was representative of the fleeting nature of wealth, riches, and life itself. (D)",
                "paragraph 4": "In modern history, numerous artists and art critics have rejected the notion that art should imitate nature. Some artists have viewed art as a means of personal expression or even as an abstract, impersonal essence. According to them, the natural appearance of an object should be a **subordinate** concern. For example, Vasily Kandinsky believed that abstraction was an eternal artistic force that was not related to the world of form but only to that of pure experience. Regardless of the definition of art’s true nature, like all things learned, art is evaluated within the cultural context of artists, and all people engaged in artistic crafts share one thing in common: they operate within the bounds of the institutions, traditions, and expectations of a culture."

        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "Savanna grasslands are one of Earth’s eight major land biomes, which are large areas that are classified by their vegetation, climate, wildlife, and soil. A savanna shares features with both **a forest and a desert**, as it is characterized by grass, shrubs, and widely scattered trees. Most commonly located near the equator, savannas are found on every continent apart from Antarctica, amounting to about 20 percent of the land on the planet. On some continents, like North America and Asia, the savannas are quite small. The largest concentration of savanna grassland is in Africa, where this distinctive biome covers five million square miles, around half of the continent.",
                "paragraph 2": "The climate in a savanna is exceptionally dry; in fact, there are only two seasons. The rainy season, also known as the monsoon season due to the **intensity** of the rainfall, lasts about six months and usually features about twenty to fifty inches of rainfall. The dry season that extends throughout the rest of the year is essentially rainless. Temperatures remain fairly constant throughout both seasons, ranging from sixty to one hundred degrees Fahrenheit.",
                "paragraph 3": "Plant life in the savanna must be capable of surviving without much water for about half of the year. The grass grows to be quite thick and tall during the rainy season, sometimes reaching heights of ten feet, but then turns brown when there is a scarcity of water. Even though lightning often causes fire in the dry season, the grass survives because it stores water in its roots, ensuring that these remain unharmed even if the stems and leaves are destroyed by the flames. The grass roots actually supply water to the porous red soil rather than the other way around. **Few trees can survive these conditions, but the baobab tree has adapted by growing leaves only when the rain falls and storing water in its thick trunk**. The acacia tree grows roots so deep that they get past the soil, finding groundwater underneath. Acacia trees have also evolved to defend their leaves from animals. The leaves of these trees have sharp thorns, are often covered by stinging ants, and contain a poisonous chemical that discourages giraffes from munching on **them**.",
                "paragraph 4": "Wildlife, too, must cope with the extreme climate. Many species accomplish this by migrating throughout the savanna in search of territory that is not experiencing drought. Fortunately for the birds, insects, and mammals that thrive there, droughts are often localized. Some small animals burrow into the ground and remain inactive during the dry season. (A) In Africa, elephants utilize their long trunks and brute strength to break open baobab trees and suck water from the trees’ trunks. (B) Other animals that make their homes in the African savanna include zebras, rhinoceroses, ostriches, cheetahs, hyenas, and leopards. (C) These creatures must contend with fire as well as drought. (D) The fork-tailed drongo bird, however, benefits from wildfires as it **deliberately** flies into the flames in order to dine on roasting insects. The savanna illustrates the remarkable ability of living organisms to adapt to harsh conditions."

        "passage": [
            {
                "paragraph 1": "In the minds of many environmentally **conscious** consumers concerned about the excesses of conventional farming, organic products are a \"green\" alternative. This perception is rooted in fact: organic farms do not use synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, which can damage soil, reduce biodiversity in local ecosystems, contaminate water supplies, and compromise the health of farmers. Consequently, despite prices that are considerably higher than those of conventional products, revenues from sales of organic goods are expected to increase from $52.3 billion in 2020 to $96 billion by 2028 in the United States. The South Asian nation of Bhutan even aims to convert to 100 percent organic by 2035. However, most consumers are unaware of the environmental costs of organic farming.",
                "paragraph 2": "Organic farms actually increase the burden of carbon in our atmosphere more than conventional farms, thereby increasing the dangers of climate change. The problem is that chemical pesticides, while potentially harmful to many organisms (including humans), are actually effective at increasing crop yields. Organic farms lose crops to insects and other pests, so **they** require more land to grow the same amount of produce as conventional farms. More land for food leaves less land for forests, and the resulting decline in the amount of carbon being stored is a direct contributor to global warming because greater quantities of greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere.",
                "paragraph 3": "Also of concern are the environmental costs of some of the natural pesticides and fertilizers used by organic farmers. Many organic farms use sulfur to deter crop-consuming creatures because it is believed to be less toxic than pesticides made with synthetic chemicals. (A) While this substance is relatively less harmful, there are still serious issues associated with its use. (B) For example, farmers handling sulfur must wear eye and skin protection to avoid irritation during field work, and it is also known to cause harmful acid rain. (C) Additionally, while manure is a natural fertilizer, less than 50 percent of the nitrogen produced by manure is absorbed by crops. (D) Just because a substance is naturally produced does not necessarily mean it is not harmful to the environment.",
                "paragraph 4": "A variety of solutions are required to address the environmental concerns raised by the organic approach to agriculture. **Because they are less efficient at producing large crop yields, organic farms may not be capable of meeting the global 59 percent increase in demand for food expected over the next three decades without creating dangerous increases in greenhouse gas emissions.** Therefore, the world’s agriculture industries must strike a balance between organic and conventional farming. With regard to the problem of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers, organic farmers in industrialized nations could learn from organic farmers in developing countries like India. There, organic farms use biodiversity as a strategy for sustainability by growing plants that naturally **inhibit** pests and using legumes as an organic source of nitrogen instead of manure or synthetic fertilizers."
